# hello world

Perhaps the simplest pebl project that could be made.

Meant to make sure that your system is configured
and ready to work with pebl!

  1. start a local pebl cluster by running `pebl up`
  2. navigate to this folder and run it with `pebl run`
  3. check the `"hello, world!"` output with `pebl info`
  4. clean up by shutting down the cluster with `pebl down`
